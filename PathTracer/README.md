##Path Tracer

Our code is based on the Nvidia Optix Engine. You can download Sample Code from their Repository (we started with Sample 7, see [here](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/optix_advanced_samples/tree/master/src/optixIntroduction/optixIntro_07) )
Used filenames and parameter names to call functions are consistent the rest of their sample code. Just paste the functions into the according files and call them.

We built with:
* OptiX version 5.1.1
* GPU, driver, and CUDA toolkit 9.0
* Microsoft Visual Studio: VS 2015
